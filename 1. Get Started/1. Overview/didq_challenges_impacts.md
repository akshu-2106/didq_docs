# Challenges & Impact of DIDQ

## Challenges

Before the existence of the DIDQ framework, there was no generic process to perform data ingestion and data quality checks. Below are some major challenges that were faced while performing these tasks:

- Manual & Disconnected Process
- Risk to Data Security
- Cost Intensive
- Increased Complexity
- Unreliable Process

After introducing DIDQ framework to the system, we have overcome these challenges by:

- Building connected process with the help of resuable code and powerful error logging mechanism.
- Access Mechanism Subscription Model and advanced security policy at Azure Directory level.
- Ease of configuration on other projects. It can act as plug and play.
- Automation of data ingestion and data quality process.
- Automated data validation checks and data quality checks.

## Impacts

- Connected process and quick turnaround time
- Advanced Data security policies
- Reduces project cost by ~70%
- Efficient processing and high performance
- Better accuracy and trusted process
