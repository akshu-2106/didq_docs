# DIDQ Streaming Process

## What is Stream Processing

Stream processing is a data management technique that involves ingesting a continuous data stream to quickly analyze, filter, transform or enhance the data in real time. Once processed, the data is passed off to an application, data store or another stream processing engine.

## What is the difference between batch and streaming data?

The batch Processing model handles a large batch of data while the Stream processing model handles individual records or micro-batches of few records. In Batch Processing, it processes over all or most of the data but in Stream Processing, it processes over data on a rolling window or most recent record.
