# CntlPreMetadataFilelog

CntlPreMetadataFilelog is baseline table which is mainly used for handling the multiple files(File Handling) for single object. Initially all the file records w.r.t each object will be updated into this table after that will apply sorting mechanism. Based on sorting results, Old file will be an input for CntlMetadataFileLog to complete further process. This process will be applied for remaining files as well which are updated as file records in CntlPreMetadataFilelog.
